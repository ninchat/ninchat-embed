Examples on how to embed Ninchat to a web page using site configs. There are two different use cases for embedding:

1. Queued 1-on-1 customer service chat
2. Multiple user chat room(s)

Concepts and terminology
========================

Site config key
---------------
Site config key (configKey) is a key to a JSON config file that contains configuration for the embedded chat window.

Config key format is eg. **site/0h5sa6tl/3p4137im00ud.json** which corresponds to a config file https://api.ninchat.com/config/site/0h5sa6tl/3p4137im00ud.json

Every time an embedded Ninchat is loaded the configuration of the window is constructed by Ninchat following these steps:

1. A default site config is loaded from https://ninchat.com/asset/ninchat-defaults.json
2. A site config is loaded based on configKey parameter and merged on top of default config (eg. from here: https://api.ninchat.com/config/site/0h5sa6tl/3p4137im00ud.json)
3. Configs are loaded from configUrls or postConfigUrls if set, and merged on top of the current config
4. Environment specific configs are merged on top of current config if one or more environments are set
5. Pseudo environment configs are merged on top of current config if applicable (eg. "responsive")
6. Voil√†

Environment
-----------
Environment is a part of the site config used for a specific purpose.

If you take a look at the Ninchat default config (https://ninchat.com/asset/ninchat-defaults.json) you will notice two keys on top level of the configuration called `default` and `responsive`. These are environments. Environments can be overriden in a site config. Also additional environments can be added if required.

For example, if you would like to have a different config for Finnish and English users, you could add `fi` and `en` environments to the site config and set different languages for each environment. Then when initializing Ninchat you would add `fi` or `en` to the environments array based on the language selection of you users.

Pseudo-environment
------------------
A pseudo-environment is an environment that is automatically added to the environments array based on config settings. Currently there are following pseudo environments:

- `reactive` environent is added if `proactive` environment is not added. Thus the presence of `reactive` environment indicates that the chat window has been opened by user interaction and not by and automatic trigger. 

- `proactive` environment is added in if a chat window is opened by an automatic trigger as in following scenarios:
    1. `pageloads` trigger is set in a config and triggered in a chat window. In this example chat window is configured to open after 5 pageloads:
        ```json
        {
            "default": {
                "window": {
                    "triggers": [
                        {
                            "action": "open",
                            "amount": 5,
                            "type": "pageloads"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    2. `timeout` trigger is set in a config and triggered in a chat window. In this example chat window is configured to open after 30 seconds:
        ```json
        {
            "default": {
                "window": {
                    "triggers": [
                        {
                            "action": "open",
                            "amount": 30,
                            "type": "timeout"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```

- `responsive` environment is added in following scenarios:
    1. `responsive` is a boolean and set to true and browser client width is <= 800 pixels
        ```json
        {
            "default": {
                "window": {
                    "responsive": true
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    2. `responsive` is an integer and browser client width is <= 600 pixels
        ```json
        {
            "default": {
                "window": {
                    "responsive": 600
                }
            }
        }
        ```

configUrls and postConfigUrls
-----------------------------
- `configUrls` is an array containing a list of URLs where a GET request is made expecting a config file in return. Using configUrls a 3rd party config server can be used on top of Ninchat site configs.

- `postConfigUrls` is an array containing a list of URLs where a POST request is made expecting a config file in return. Post configs are however utilized **only after chat window is open**, which means that chat window look and feel cannot be configured in post configs.

Obtaining site config key
=========================

Config key can be obtained by following these steps:

1. Log in to Ninchat (https://ninchat.com/app)
2. Select organization name on the sidebar
3. Select "Organization settings"
4. Select "Sites"
5. Select "Create new site"

If you don't have an organization in Ninchat, please go to https://ninchat.com/contact to obtain one.
If you don't have "Organization settings" visible to you, you need to contact your organization owner for permissions.

Loading and initialization
==========================

You can load Ninchat to an existing block level element on the page (usually the chat room) or let the script create a floating element to bottom right corner of the screen (customer service). You will need to create an initialization function called `NinchatAsyncInit` and include the required JavaScript file which will call the said function after loading.


Example: Embed Ninchat using site config key
--------------------------------------------

Load the JavaScript and asynchronously initialize Ninchat to a generated floating element:

	<script type="text/javascript">
		window.NinchatAsyncInit = function() {
			window.Ninchat.embedInit({
        		configKey: 'YOUR_CONFIG_KEY'
	        });
        };

		(function(doc) {
			if (doc.getElementById('ninchat-js')) {
				return;
			}

			var js, first = doc.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];

			js     = doc.createElement('script');
			js.id  = 'ninchat-js';
			js.src = 'https://ninchat.com/js/embed2.min.js';
			first.parentNode.insertBefore(js, first);
		}(document));
	</script>

Load the JavaScript and initialize Ninchat to a pre-defined element on page:

	<div id="ninchat-iframe" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"></div>
    
	<script type="text/javascript">
		window.NinchatAsyncInit = function() {
			window.Ninchat.embedInit({
				configKey: 'YOUR_CONFIG_KEY',
				containerId: 'ninchat-iframe'
			});
		};

		(function(doc) {
			if (doc.getElementById('ninchat-js')) {
				return;
			}

			var js, first = doc.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];

			js     = doc.createElement('script');
			js.id  = 'ninchat-js';
			js.src = 'https://ninchat.com/js/embed2.min.js';
			first.parentNode.insertBefore(js, first);
		}(document));
	</script>

Public API
----------

### `Ninchat.channel`

- `channelId` : string
- `containerId` : string (optional)

Change to another channel, will join/follow if necessary.


### `Ninchat.close`

- `containerId` : string (optional)
- `forceClose` : boolean (optional)

Close floating chat window and send delete_user (if guest), same as clicking &times; or "Close chat" button. When conversation is ongoing, close confirmation is presented. When confirmed, audience rating and/or post audience questionnaire are displayed if `audienceRating` or `postAudienceQuestionnaire` are set.

If `forceClose` is set to `true`, chat is closed and user is deleted: no confirmations, ratings or questionnaires are displayed. Possible scenario for using `forceClose` could be during logout process on embedding site. 


### `Ninchat.dialogue`

- `userId` : string
- `containerId` : string (optional)

Open a private conversation with the specified user.


### `Ninchat.earlyMetadata`

- `data` : object

Add or replace parts of the initial `audienceMetadata` object.  Returns a
boolean; true is returned if Ninchat hasn't been started yet (i.e. the initial
metadata could still be modified).

The [`Ninchat.metadata`](#ninchatmetadata) function may be used to send
metadata to the chat after Ninchat has already been started.


### `Ninchat.embedInit`

- `_options` : object

Initialize embedded chat, see available options in [Initialization options](#initialization-options).


### `Ninchat.metadata`

- `data` : object
- `fold` : boolean (optional)

interleaved with other messages in the chat.

The data object contains arbitrary string keys mapped to string values.  If
fold is true, the values override previous values of the keys.  Fold is false
by default.

As opposed to [`Ninchat.earlyMetadata`](#ninchatearlymetadata), this function
works at any time.


### `Ninchat.start`

- `containerId` : string (optional)

Start chat if `autoStart` is set to `false`.


### `Ninchat.toggle`
